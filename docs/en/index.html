        garden of Hans and Sam! There will be live music, a programme with

      <p>
        To cover for the costs of the festival we are asking a contribution of
        <b>‚Ç¨40</b> per day on the festival. All costs the are related to the
        festival are covered by this fee. Our goal of the festival is not to
        make money. But in the end we want to break even on the costs. In the
        contribution the following costs are taken into account:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Breakfast</li>
        <li>Lunch</li>
        <li>Coffee/ tea</li>
        <li>Snacks (melonas/ manzanas)</li>
        <li>Beersd/ Wines, plenty</li>
        <li>Costs soundengineer/ equipmentcosts</li>
        <li>Rental costs tents</li>
        <li>Gas for cooking and feeding the electrical generators</li>
        <li>
          Facility costs. Like natural soap (to not spoil the lake) and
          dishwashing liquid)
        </li>
        <li>Construction costs (screws, etc)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We will inventorize which days you'll be visiting the festival. Based on
        this info we'll ask you to transfer your contribution before the
        festival.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides the costs the cover for the festival expenses we will make sure
        vistors can donate money to the artists.

        <b>Important:</b> if you have the idea that 40 euro per day is too much
        for you budget (for example because you invested all your money in
        bitcoin in 2021). Please let us know so we will be able to arrange
        something with you :)

      <a id="eten"><h2>Food & Drinks</h2></a>
      <p>
        We will make sure there is enough wine, (local) beer, drinking water and
        different syrups for lemonades. In case you are a huge alcophile we want
        to ask you to bring some extra booze. We will buy enough beer and wine
        but we're not counting on the extremes. We also take care of breakfast,
        lunch and dinner on 5, 6, 7 august. Several vegetarian and vegan options
        will be available. In case of any other requirements, please let us know
        as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foodwise, think of wood oven pizza's from Hans, fresh baguette with
        confiture and French cheese and salads with local herbs and veggies.

        There is 1 bio (compost) toilet and there are several spaces where we

        There are no showers or running water, however you can swim and wash
        yourself in the lake. Washing here is only allowed with a special
        biodegradable soap that will not interfere with the flora and fauna. We
